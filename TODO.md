TODO:

- Websockets
- game loop


GENERAL IDEA:

- Have users connect to server via a code / sign-up (websockets)
- Give users a prompt to fill out (gameloop)
    - Save their prompts to database
- Once prompt time is done (game loop)
    - give users back other users prompts to vote on
    - save all votes

- Show winner on screen
- go again *yay*
